# Spring Boot EC2 Docker CI/CD

This repository demonstrates deploying a Spring Boot application to an AWS EC2 instance using Docker and GitHub Actions for a CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS EC2 Instance**:
   - Ensure you have an EC2 instance set up with Docker installed.
   - Configure security group rules to allow necessary ports (e.g., 8080 for the application).

2. **GitHub Secrets**:
   Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `AWS_EC2_HOST`: Public IP or domain of the EC2 instance.
   - `AWS_EC2_USER`: Username for SSH access (e.g., `ec2-user` or `ubuntu`).
   - `AWS_EC2_KEY`: Private SSH key for accessing the EC2 instance.

3. **Docker Installed Locally**: For testing Docker images before deployment.

â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Project documentation

## Dockerfile

A simple `Dockerfile` for building the Spring Boot app:

```dockerfile
# Use a base image with Java 17 runtime
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application JAR file into the container
COPY target/springboot-example.jar springboot-example.jar

# Expose the required port
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "springboot-example.jar"]
```

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

A basic `deploy.yml` file for deploying the app:

```yaml
name: Deploy Spring Boot App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: [ubuntu-24.04]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v3
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'
      - name: Build Project
        run: mvn clean install -DskipTests
      - name: Login to Docker hub
        run: docker login -u ${{secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME}} -p ${{secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD}}
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t wicklak/formula1 .
      - name: Publish Image to Docker Hub
        run: docker push wicklak/formula1:latest
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: [aws-ec2]
    steps:
      - name: Pull Image from docker hub
        run: docker pull wicklak/formula1:latest
      - name: Delete old Delete old container
        run: docker rm -f formula1-container
      - name: Run docker container
        run: docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name formula1-container wicklak/formula1

```

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/springboot-ec2-docker-ci-cd.git
   cd springboot-ec2-docker-ci-cd
   ```

2. Build the application locally:
   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```

3. Build and run the Docker image locally:
   ```bash
   docker build -t springboot-app .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 springboot-app
   ```

4. Push changes to the `main` branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow and deploy to EC2.

---

## Notes

- Ensure the EC2 instance has sufficient resources to run the application.
- Monitor the application's logs using Docker:
  ```bash
  docker logs <container-id>
  ```
- Update security group rules to allow traffic to port `8080` if necessary.
